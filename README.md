# Gravitational-Wave-Audiofication-and-Instrument-Classification
This was my final project for Astro 9: Python Programming in Astronomy. I researched the applications of the Fourier Transform in audio analysis and used Nyquist sampling to "audiofy" LIGO strain data, representative of detected gravitational waves. Additionally, I built a classifier using Fourier Analysis to categorize sound files as A4, F3, or F4 pitches.

Please see PDF_Version.pdf for a PDF of the project. Project.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code and markdown.
