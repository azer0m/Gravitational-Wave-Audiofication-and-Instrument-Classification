## Astro 9: Final Project
**Due by Monday, August 14th at 6pm**

In order ot submit the final project, you will need to add and commit **all materials** to this repository.

At the very minimum, you should be submitting your lab-report **in pdf format** and a python script containing your code.
If you used a Jupyter Notebook for your final, that may contain both at the same time.

Hey Nick,

My project is all submitted through the Project.ipynb notebook -- code, figures, as well as lab report. At the top of the notebook is a button to toggle on/off code, in case the code is cluttering too much of the lab report. Additionally, if for whatever reason the notebook doesn't work or open, I also attached a PDF titled PDF_Version, and that has the lab report.

Thanks for a great summer! I really enjoyed this class!
